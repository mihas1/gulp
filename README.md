# gulp

Simple gulp config to build some html/css code in easy way.
I don't like codepen or something else.

First of all you need to load this repo.
Then in terminal move to this directory and open.
Install all dependencies(npm install / yarn install).
Then just run 'gulp' in your terminal and start working.
